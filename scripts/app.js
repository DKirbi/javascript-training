//Variables should be written in camelCase if multiple words are stuck together
//Variables cannot start with numbers or have hypens inside them

// Constants are variables that will not change in the future. If a constant has a hardcoded value, it is best to write that constant in an UPPERCASE
//const age = someCode(BIRTHDAY); 
//Here we have an example of const age, which is going to get a value from a function during runtime, therefore it can be written in camelCase, whereas BIRTHDAY is written in uppercase, since we hardcoded its value.
