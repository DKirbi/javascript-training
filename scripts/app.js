// ! (NOT) is the boolean NOT operator represented by the exclamation sign !

//const result3 = !someValue;

//The operator accepts a single argument and does the following: 
//1. Covnerts the operand to boolean type: true/false
//2. Returns the inverse value

console.log(!"non-empty string"); //simply converts the value to boolean and inverses it to false

console.log(!!"non-empty string"); // converts the string to a boolean value and double inverses it to true

//A double !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type
//There is a better way of writing this with the built-in Boolean function
